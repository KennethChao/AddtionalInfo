# Technical interview
 * Culture Fit
   * Based on your past experience in academic research and/or working at companies, what are the big-pictures issues facing robotics?
   * What is needed to address these issues

 * Review resume. Verify that they lead the work, by asking:
   * What was the motivation for the project? Extension of another project, or grant proposal written by advisor, etc?
   * How many people worked on the project? 
   * What was novel about the project from a theoretical / mathematical perspective?
   * What were the challenges in implementing this in a real robot?
   * What software libraries were used? How long did the computation take?

 * Review fundamentals
   * can formulate and solve a newton force-balance, from a system description. Use a system that was not used in their research.
   * knows the equation, meaning of the tuning parameters, and has implemented in c/c++/python, at least one of the following:
     * classical control theory. for example low-pass filter or PID
     * state-space estimation. for example Kalman filter
     * operational-space. analytical or QP.
     * motion planning.
 * if knowledge is borderline, but want to give them the benefit of the doubt, candidate must pass another 1 hour technical phone screen. This is a deep-dive into a specific area of strength, that makes up for the weaker area. The area of strength does not have to be theoretical.
